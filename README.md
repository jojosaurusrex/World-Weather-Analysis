# World-Weather-Analysis

## Resources
- Data Source: Generated from OpenWeather and Google maps
- Software: Python 3.10.2, Jupyter Notebook 4.10.3

## Overview
This challenge tested our API knnowledge and how to use them effectively by:
- Generating random coordinates of cities
- Retrieving, collecting, cleaning, and plotting data
- using google APIs to create heatmaps

## Summary
World Weather Analysis challenge allowed students to learn about APIs. Started with OpenWeather to track weather in different cities from all over the world and formed it into a datframe and then into a csv to use later down the road. Pulled data from that csv we generated in order to add markers onto a map and find directions from location to location.
